## Training structure

- Each day will consist of eight hours of training
  - Training is broken up into lectures and exercises
  - We will lecture on a subject, then we will exercise that knowledge by writing some code
- Breaks at roughly 2 hour intervals
- Questions are welcome at any point!
  - We want you to ask as many questions as possible
  - Never be afraid to ask a question for any reason.
  - If something is unclear, that is my fault, not yours - don't let us move on until you understand!
- We will hopefully cover everything you need to know to build modern Angular applications

## Why use Angular 2?

- Modular architecture
- Much better performance than Angular 1:
  - Improved Change detection
  - Ahead of Time compiler
  - Server-side rendering through Angular Universal can result in blazing-fast performance
- Built using modern best practices
  - Complex dependency injection system
    - Easy to build decoupled code that is isolatable and therefore unit-testable
  - TypeScript
    - Provides build-time verifiability that was missing in previous Angular versions and other frameworks
- Browser-independent renderer allows Angular 2 projects to be run inside the browser, or inside NodeJS, or even inside a native mobile application (NativeScript)
- A complete and opinionated solution which does not require you to piece together a frontend technology stack
- Learnings from Angular 1 resulted in a rewritten framework that addresses many of the challenges of building modern web applications
